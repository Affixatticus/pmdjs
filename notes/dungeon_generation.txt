Generators:
0x01 STD Half rooms
0x02 One room (monster house)
0x03 Rooms inside, corridors out
0x04 Corridors inside, rooms out
0x05 Two large rooms, one MH
0x06 Five rooms in a line
0x07 Five rooms in a cross
0x08 STD Full rooms
0x09 Rooms inside, nothing out
0x0A Rooms out, nothing inside
0x0B STD 3/4 rooms

STD Size is 56x32
but only inside 52x28 are used

(1) Room is cleared
(2) Borders are placed
(3) Place down rooms
+ Some full, some 1x1
HOW:
-Split available space by M vertical sectors and N horizontal sectors.
- M and N change depending on floor and a random factor
- Each room is at least 5 wide and 4 tall, at max sector size
- Dimensions are preferrably odd
- Ratio is at least 2:3
WHAT ABOUT 1x1 ROOMS?
- Some rooms are dummy rooms
- Depending on room density (D)
- Determines how many rooms will spawn and how many will be dummies
- Negative number means exactly abs(D) rooms (still, not less than 2)
and positive number adds some random variance
MERGED ROOMS:
- Additionally, each adjacent se of vertical rooms, has a 5% chance of getting merged
- A merged room is created by creating a rectangle that covers both rooms



(4) Connect rooms
+ Find a collinear point
+ Trace line between rooms, passing through the poin
(5) Generate dead ends
+ Pick a random room
+ Draw a line, one point at a time, turning randomly
+ Ends when reach borders or another room
+ Repeat some times
(6) Replace borders (see if necessary)
(7) Place special triggers at intersections between rooms and corridors
(8) Generate special features (like water)
HOW:
- Generate a random path going through the map (never overriding floor space)
- Find n = terrainDensity points, and create 8x8 areas of randomly places water tiles (not full)
(9) Placing items and traps
- Ground item density
  X-2:X+2 items
- Tile density
  X/2:X traps/magic tiles (max of 56)
- Buried item density
  X-2:X+2 items inside walls
(10) Generate monster house
- 0-100 percentage H
- Only one room can be a monster house
- Place additional traps and items in said room
(11) Keckleon Shop
- 0-100 pecentage K
- Only one room can be a Keckleon shop
- Carpet is roomSize.inflate(-1) big, but can be reduced in size up to a minumum of 3x3

(12) Enjoy
